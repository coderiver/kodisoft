Of course, you can try to enter long given a 16 -letter passwords on a small screen, using a touch-screen keyboard. But all the inconveniences immediately obvious: it is necessary to spend a lot of time , similar to a password is very easy to spy and very difficult to remember . Our friend and partner of the United States came up with a very simple and fundamental concept . And what if the password is not text and picture ... or music , or your position on the map. In general, any audio and visual information. Plus, what if he can change the password every time you run , making it virtually impossible to fit. This idea and called "dynamic audiovisual password", or short - Avimir. And this was only the beginning . Avimir'a main advantage that it and its own unique for each user.</p>
					<p>I, for example , can create your avimir of 10 random images and me to log on, you will need to choose two with the dog. Someone more like avimir, where you need to get into the rhythm of your favorite song , while playing on the background 3 more unfamiliar tunes. Someone wants to be avimir open automatically every time he comes home. But the possibilities do not end there . Avimir - is a complete tool for marketing and brand awareness . Brand can create a personal account for each user , using avimir: the bank may be your avimir, while the supermarket chain - its. Moreover, all our avimir'y are designed to be backward compatible with conventional passwords , all the mechanics and mathematics to transform takes on our program . Avimir - this is the first personal protection.</p></article>

						<p>After the success idbm, we began to think about expanding the range of marketing devices. And during a visit to one of the shows we noticed interactive floor . Projector , motion sensor and a game of football - so look in those days , such a system . The idea was shocking and we liked it very much , but the execution made ​​itself felt . That's when we decided to raise the bar on technology in this area and began work on a new system - kolight. The first step was to develop a system of pattern recognition and motion. In those days, the technology in this area were quite weak - we had a lot of things to "invent ". We worked a lot of options both hardware and mathematically - algorithmic part . We have already had experience with artificial intelligence , but it was our first project in the field of computer vision . Initially, we set out to make the device as compact and portable , so we were limited in computational resources . We had to use the incredible ways to optimize our algorithms and , even , parallel computing technology , peeped during the development of high- loaded websites. </p>
						<p>During the existence of the platform and the core of the system have been about a dozen steps , together with the progress and discoveries in the field of computer vision and increase the computing power of processors. Kolight and still is at the peak of progress - a branch of artificial vision is one of the research priorities for most modern universities. Next, we set about creating interactive effects , and then it was the sore spot of such systems. Effects often corresponded to a specific task and did not allow a flexible manipulation of content : everything that could be done - it change the background to another image . And then our system shone : it permitted to create full effects using only a mouse. The user can completely change the atmosphere and branding each of the fifty patterns of effects throughout the entire 10 minutes , and create your own - after just one week of training. In addition, the extended system used Pro professional graphics and physical packages in order to give access to the super- modern and realistic content. Naturally, the system can be synchronized via the Internet, to stitch images into a huge canvas to work with video support augmented reality - all possibilities are countless. Kolight became confident step in a new direction of the company.</p>

It was with him and started the company's entry into the market of marketing. Spark was , in fact, a small application - addition to the information kiosk , which lets you download desired file via bluetooth. We have long experimented with it during one of the discussions we have struck - this is a whole new channel of communication. We can set our microdevice in a public place , and passing by all visitors will receive an email from us , the device is able to identify the people passing by and prepare a personal message to each of them. And all this as interactive as possible - the user can choose what to download or unsubscribe . This was the basis for future devices , and then in the course went fantasy. </p>
					<p>We have added a broadcast , lottery, user identification , quizzes, feedback and more. Much time was spent on the selection of the most reliable and compact platform : we have tried a lot of very exotic operating systems tested all possible bluetooth stacks and transmitters tried many processors, but it was worth it - the device has turned out very compact , reliable and intelligent. After the completion of the trial Casey , was the installation of the device on the food court for a famous brand, and then another , further afield , and so on . Technology began to grow: there were whole network content , devices started to communicate with each other, and technology has come nemerenoe amount of creativity from us and our partners. Originality shares held through our technology and literacy hit its uniqueness. So eventually grew into a full idbm platform to conduct any shares in mobile marketing and to this day remains one of our flagship products .</p></article>

And one of them , we are faced with the construction of printing . It was a business that needed intervention. The main focus on the module we did work with customers - CRM. The system allows you to store and keep track of the smallest details the client's wishes , kept track layouts and design preferences and allows you to see the entire history of working together - in short, allows you to build relationships between organizations and not between managers . System has been and distribution of access rights - employees see only the information they need , the leadership is always the opportunity to view aerial view.

					<article class="products__descr fs18"><p>We have our own platform to work with databases , which is now called KoCloud. In the days of its inception often used a small business for the organization of work within the company . We conducted many presentations - talks about the benefits of the system. And one of them , we are faced with the construction of printing . It was a business that needed intervention. The main focus on the module we did work with customers - CRM. The system allows you to store and keep track of the smallest details the client's wishes , kept track layouts and design preferences and allows you to see the entire history of working together - in short, allows you to build relationships between organizations and not between managers . System has been and distribution of access rights - employees see only the information they need , the leadership is always the opportunity to view aerial view. When industrial printing is often used very specialized equipment , with special paper, inks and other consumables. The system was able to control, to work with him , keep track of the state of warehouse and remind you when any of the materials coming to an end . Then we spent a lot of effort to work with business organizations of different stores , and this project has led to the birth of KoCloud platform as it is today .</p></article>

With access to a huge budget and one of the largest arsenals of technology , most doctors still prefer to use paper and pen . We never liked it and we , together with our partners , we decided to change it . So , a system of MedicalPro. Of course, all the standard features in CRM and ERP systems have been implemented , with particular diligence. But the emphasis was placed on the following - the system allows you to integrate and synchronize many disparate medical devices , read each of them , and most importantly - collect them in a single window in which any qualified doctor will be instantly visible status of the patient. Inside the system was available card histories , prescribed and taken medications surveys contraindications, diagnoses , and even graphic information , such as X-rays. The system also takes on the part of administrative responsibility : she was able to work with schedules and visits , distribute offices, monitor the workload of staff to distribute the survey to monitor the delivery of drugs and more. Communication with the doctor has become much easier .</p></article>

					<article class="products__descr fs18"><p>Very simple idea - you have a game , there are 200 dolls , each of which you pick up wardrobe , accessories and makeup. Purpose - to completely transfer the image you like from the head on the screen. Many first try to copy their favorite character . After playing for a bit , notice that they do not like some little detail, the finished image , then another , another , and so on . And so there are brand new characters , creating their children develop imagination , and then some even make their creative profession. Our customer first wanted to create a game for my granddaughter and it's probably one of the best motivations that could ever be . Task was - to remove all obstacles to the manifestation of fantasy. We have something to work with , and we did not disappoint . The system has added more than 2,000 models of dolls and more than 20,000 items and wardrobe accessories. We were allowed to create their own unique characters, using facial plastic and many other options to make them daily and festive wardrobe , create interiors , apartments and even build entire home. Very quickly, the system began to live my life : dolls were born and died , friends, and even quarreled sometimes married . The system was present and the social element , the characters could make friends and integrate into the group . We have not forgotten about the educational element - it was a mini-game , coaching knowledge and logic. The system has become the epitome of pure fantasy .</p></article>

He was able to communicate via Bluetooth. Knew all about the current user , aligned to him and helped him . He knew about customer purchases , its discounts, promotions , advise new purchases or just a place to visit, could entertain his classic game , music or give read the latest news.

And it's not reached the 10 minute task , and a very complex industrial process, requiring the intervention of the Institute with a long experience of research. On how, where, how long and with what parameters you just dry wood depends on what you can make of it , the color , the quality and flexibility of future products. Our task - to broadcast library research and mathematical calculations into something that people can use , with little or no computer experience . The system had to understand and work with more than a dozen parameters simultaneously : she must have known about the type of wood , 3 different kinds of humidity, temperature 8 types , the exact time of day, time of drying and much more. It was also necessary to ensure complete stability and autonomy of the system. Each run of the program had a solid budget and failures were unacceptable . When problems have been solved , we went to innovate. The weakest point of the modern industrial system - the user interface . While working with them the feeling that control a spaceship - a huge number of buttons, lights and circuit breakers . And then stepped in our experience . We have created a system where you can easily enjoy all the drying modes , to begin the process in 3 mouse click , and create their own profiles , which give a special quality of materials and color. We believe that brought some aesthetic culture in most industries.</p></article>

					<article class="products__descr fs18"><p>The onscreen keyboard has always been the weakest point of any touch-screen device. She actually tries to repeat a mechanical device , created 100 years ago, which should always lie horizontally on the table , and specifically designed for the trained user dials " medium text" all 10yu fingers. When it comes to entering text , any portable device almost immediately becomes unusable . Not to mention the fact that the current SMS - this is not the average text 100 years ago. Such problems are solved by system WitBoard. Fully -screen "keyboard " adapts to a particular person , his style and print texts, which he usually enters . The system performs statistical analysis of the texts , trying to predict the next letter entered and transforms this knowledge into a screen prompt to the user. View tips depends on the device : it can be a path , moving away , or even rain letters familiar keyboard . The result is a new way to enter text . Entering could not be specifically designed for children or people with disabilities. Classical keyboard was no longer a mandatory attribute , because one could easily enter your text into the phone. Ironically, innovation sometimes literally in the hands of the developer.</p></article>
